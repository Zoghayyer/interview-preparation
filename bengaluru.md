# Interview Preparation for Bengaluru version of the Coding Exercise  

## Is our workplace compatible with what you are looking for?
- Have a look at the "About Us" section of the [American Interview Preparation](https://github.com/cjdev/interview-preparation).
  This applies to all CJ offices regardless of where they are in the world.

## What will the coding exercise be like?
- This is a combination of the coding portions of the "Web screen" and "In person interview" interviews mentioned in the
  [American Interview Preparation](https://github.com/cjdev/interview-preparation), except that it is all done in
  [coderpad](https://coderpad.io/sandbox).  Pay particular attention to the "What we are looking for" and 
  "Maintaining existing code" sections 

### What we are looking for
- Not implementing things there is no requirement for.
- Minimally implementing features one at a time.
- Being able to operate in red/green/refactor style.
- Understanding of design principles.

### Maintaining existing code
- Maintaining existing code
    - Make sure you understand how to practically apply abstraction in code
    - For a concrete example of applying abstraction, search the web for "Replace conditional with polymorphism"
    - You will have a pairing partner to help keep you on track regarding the red/green/refactor style of programming
    - Design decisions will be left up to you to either justify or change as appropriate 
    - You won't necessarily know the programming language for this exercise, but you will have a pairing partner
        - Understands everything about the language and libraries
        - If you can precisely articulate your intent, your pairing partner can help you with the syntax
        - Can explain anything about how the code is
        - Sometimes gets stuck on design decisions, you will have to take the lead on this
